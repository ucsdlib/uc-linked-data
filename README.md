# UC Linked Data Project Team
The UC Linked Data Project Team has been charged by the UC Libraries Direction and Oversight Committee to investigate and report on Linked Data possibility and implications for UC Libraries.  

With the objective to: "Develop a deeper understanding within the UC Libraries of the potential benefits of adopting a Linked Data approach to exposing and/or managing metadata in various environments, and the infrastructure required to support implementation of Linked Data system-wide projects in the future."
